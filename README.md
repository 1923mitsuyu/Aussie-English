# What made me want to create this app
- I decided to create this app because I believed it would help people coming to Australia to get used to Australian English. I am currently studying Computer Science at Queensland University of Technology and have been in Brisbane, Australia for one and a half years. I have come across many people who say that they do not understand what the locals are saying. They expressed a desire to improve their English by interacting with locals, but making Australian friends can be challenging. This experience in Australia inspired me to create an application that would solve this problem. This app enables people to get more exposure to Australian English and feel more confident about talking with locals in English.

# What I want to add to the app in the future 
One thing I woudl like to implement in the future is the push notifucation function. When it comes to learning languages, it is essential to study the languages every day even a little bit, so I believe that it is reasonable to send a notification every morning to encourage users to access the app and spare some time to learn a new thing. Another thing is the addition of audio to the example sentences. As well as vocabulary, the accents make it challenging for the people from other countries in Australia to understand what locals say, so I am planning to add audio so that the users can practice listening or just pronuncing words.
