# What made me want to create this app
- I decided to create this app because I believed it would help people coming to Australia to get used to Australian English. I am currently studying Computer Science at Queensland University of Technology and have been in Brisbane, Australia for one and a half years. I have come across many people who say that they do not understand what the locals are saying. They expressed a desire to improve their English by interacting with locals, but making Australian friends can be challenging. This experience in Australia inspired me to create an application that would solve this problem. This app enables people to get more exposure to Australian English and feel more confident about talking with locals in English.
