## What made me want to create this app

I decided to create this app because I believed it would help people coming to Australia to get used to Australian English. I am currently studying Computer Science at Queensland University of Technology and have been in Brisbane, Australia for one and a half years. I have come across many people who say that they do not understand what the locals are saying. They expressed a desire to improve their English by interacting with locals, but making Australian friends can be challenging. This experience in Australia inspired me to create an application that would solve this problem. This app enables people to get more exposure to Australian English and feel more confident about talking with locals in English.

~ Main Feature of the App ~ 
1. The players can choose how many words they want to learn, ranging from 10 to 40.
2. They can focus on only the words they answered incorrectly until they answer them correctly.
3. The words the players answered correctly will be listed, and a couple of example sentences will be visible when the words are tapped.
4. The scores will be displayed on the score page and can be removed if needed.
5. The words are searchable from the search bar at the top on the title page.

## What I want to add to the app in the future 
One thing I would like to implement in the future is the push notification function. When it comes to learning languages, it is essential to study the languages every day even a little bit, so I believe that it is reasonable to send a notification every morning to encourage users to access the app and spare some time to learn something new. Another thing is the addition of audio to the example sentences. In addition to vocabulary, accents make it challenging for people from other countries to understand what locals say. Therefore, I am planning to add audio so that users can practice listening or just pronouncing words.
